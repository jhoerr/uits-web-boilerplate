## UITS web boilerplate

We have put together a barebones boilerplate with all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you need to get started using the IT brand on the web. This includes all of the CSS for the [pattern library](http://it.iu.edu/brand/pattern-library/) we have built that makes it faster to build websites with modular components.

### Getting started

These boilerplate files will help you to quickly layout pages based on the [pattern library](http://it.iu.edu/brand/pattern-library/) we have put together, but we could not possibly account for all of the different design decisions that come up when laying out a page. For this we have inluded a separate filed called ```app.css``` where you can place any site-specific overides.

**Example**

For instance, if you have inline links in a block of text that sits on a dark background and the default link color doesn't create enough contrast. You can use ```app.css``` to overide the default link styles for that section of you page and style the link in a more appropriate way for that context.

### Feedback and contributing

We are still working on on ways to make our pattern library and this boilerplate better, so if you are using plase give us your feedback. If you are using the boilerplate and have an idea for a feature or run into any problems, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ITDCD/uits-web-boilerplate/pulls) or open a [new issue](https://github.com/ITDCD/uits-web-boilerplate/issues) and we'll have a look.
